## 🚀 Key Features

* 📷 Image-based crop disease detection
* 🧠 Ensemble deep learning approach for high accuracy
* 🌱 Early-stage disease identification
* 💊 Recommended treatments for detected diseases
* 📱 Accessible via smartphones (web-based mobile app)

## 🧠 Technical Approach

Instead of relying on a single deep learning model, this system uses an **ensemble-based CNN architecture** combined with **transfer learning** to improve prediction reliability.

### Models Used

* **VGG-19**
* **ResNet-50**
* **Inception V3**
* **GAN (for data augmentation and robustness)**

This ensemble approach enhances accuracy and generalization across different crop disease images.
